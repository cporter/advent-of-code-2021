# Advent of Code, 2021

## Rules (cp)

You can only use any programming language once. 

## Solutions


* [Sonar Sweep](01/sonar_sweep.sh) (Bash) and part two, the [Sliding Window](01/sliding_window.sh).
  Run `./sliding_window.sh < input.txt | ./sonar_sweep.sh` to get the final answer.
* [Dive](02/dive.awk) (Awk) `./dive.awk < input.txt` (part one is in an earlier commit.)

## PL's I'm comfortable enough working with on day 1

* ~~Bash~~
* C
* C++ *(Should C and C++ count separately?)*
* D
* Haskell
* Java
* Java\*\*\*\*\*\*
* Perl

* C#
* Clojure
* Erlang
